# Amplify Datastore - JS

This is the sample code to illustrate the AWS News Blog post : [Amplify Datastore - Simplify Development of Offline Apps with GraphQL](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amplify-datastore-simplify-development-of-offline-apps-with-graphql)

## Prerequisite:

Install Amplify CLI

```sh
npm i -g @aws-amplify/cli
```

## Create a new react app

```sh
npx create-react-app amplify-datastore-js-e2e --use-npm
```

```sh
cd amplify-datastore-js-e2e
```

## Add DataStore to your app

This adds support for datastore, it created the API for you (there is no need to type `amplify add api` after this)

```sh
npx amplify-app
```
